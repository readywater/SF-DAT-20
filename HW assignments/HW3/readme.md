DS | Unit Project 3

### PROMPT

In this project, you will use a few methods learned in the class to deal with missing values. 

**Goal:** An IPython notebook writeup that provides solutions to our missing data.

### DELIVERABLES

#### IPython Notebook Exploratory Analysis

- **Requirements:**
  - Read in your dataset, determine how many variables suffer from missing points. 
  - Drop rows that have missing values in all the columns you identified. 
  - Use mean to fill in the dataset. 
  - Use regression lines to fill in missing data. 
  - Replace values that are predicted to be more or less than maximum and minimum by Max and Min.


- **Bonus:**
    - Use regression with error as your imputation method. 

- **Submission:**
    - This project is due on March 2nd 2016 at 6:30PM. Please submit it to Michael Twardos via Slack.

### EVALUATION

Your project will be assessed using the following standards:

Dealing with missing data



Requirements for these standards will be assessed using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

While your total score is a helpful gauge of whether you've met overall project goals, __specific scores are more important__ since they'll show you where to focus your efforts in the future!
